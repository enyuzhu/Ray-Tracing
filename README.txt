1. I compiled my code by running mkdir build, cd build, cmake .., and make. I reran make each time with edits and
had to go into my build folder to run ./assignment4 followed by the input scene, output text, and bounces. I tested with MacOS.
2. The OpenGL online textbook was really helpful to reference libraries and syntax.
3. There were some warnings that time was initialized after system, but the code still worked.
4. I didn't do any extra credits due to a time crunch from midterms this week.
5. This was such a fun project and being an architecure major, it's cool to see the code behind my renderings.
